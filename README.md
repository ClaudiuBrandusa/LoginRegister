# LoginRegister
A web app with login, register &amp; sql database management system.  
There are 3 web pages, login.aspx, register.aspx and dashboard.aspx.
# Requirements
- .NET Framework 3.8 Runtime. 
- .NET Framework 3.8 SDK.
- Visual Studio with ASP.NET installed (or another C# IDE).
- Microsoft SQL Server Management 18.
# The Database
I use Microsoft SQL server as my Database. In 'db' folder I left the query for the Database generation called 'db.sql'.
There I inserted the account called 'Admin' with the password 'root'.  
The Database contains a table called 'no_encrypt', all of the usernames from this table have an unencrypted password.
# Additional Details
- The pages are not responsive, the recommended resolution is 960x1080.
- You can make a Member (rank 0) a Moderator (rank 1) or an Admin (rank 2) only from the Database for now.
- You will be redirected to login.aspx if you try to enter Dashboard.aspx without loging or registering before.
- The app has two themes, light theme (contains shades of gray) and dark theme (contains shades of dark gray).
# The UI
There are some images with the app.
